# Dota2Cheat: now with Lua!

![Screenshot_462](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66470490/221685025-95ce9474-6eeb-4a1d-aa2b-09b184710173.png)

There weren't many open-source Dota cheats. And so I decided to fix that.
Written in C++20 with love

Some SDK bits were fully or partionally taken from [McDota](https://github.com/LWSS/McDota) by LWSS. It's a very helpful source regarding memory structures

Using [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the interface, cheers to their wonderful creators!

also using [Minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) for bytehooking

also using Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) library for net message handling

also using [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/) and [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) for scripting

## Building
Open the project in Visual Studio and build as **Release x64**

## Injecting
You need to have libprotobuf DLLs in your the folder with dota2.exe, get them from a release in this repo or install protobuf via vcpkg and get them from the vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin folder

This cheat can be safely reinjected at any point of the game

I recommend using [Extreme Injector v3.7.2](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=21570) with either Thread Hijacking or the default option

This damn injector can apparently suddenly stop working at all(the .exe won't launch) so you can compile the Dota2Loader project from this repo if that ever happens

**ABSOLUTELY DETECTABLE BY VAC, FOR USE IN DEMO MODE OR A LOBBY** (Memory Map support WIP)

# Features
To open the cheat menu, press Insert

This list is subject to frequent change as I'm testing new features

* Automation:
  * Uses Magic Wand and Faerie Fire with customizable health tresholds
  * Uses Hand of Midas on nearby big neutrals, ranged & flagbearer lane creeps and catapults
  * Bounty rune & Aegis pickup
  * Tome of Knowledge purchase
  * Redirects spell casts from illusions to the real hero
  * Mana & HP abuse with items like Arcane Boots
  * AutoDodge for projectiles(can't dodge point-blank, am working on it)
  
* Information:
  * ~~Visible by Enemy~~ RIP on 21.02.2023, you shall not be forgotten
  * Roshan â€” saves his death time and approximates when he will spawn [WIP]
  * Draw circles of custom radius around you hero(e. g. to see XP receiving range)
  * Shows point-cast spells(Sunstrike, Torrent, Light Strike Array)
  * Shows target-cast spells(Assassinate, Charge of Darkness)
  * Shows Linken's Sphere effect on heroes
  * Renders any and all possible particles, including in FoW
  * Customizable enemy illusion coloring
  * Shows trajectories of enemy projectiles like Mirana's arrow and non-projectile abilities like Meat Hook
 
* Convars:
  * `sv_cheats` spoofing
  * customizable `dota_camera_distance` with proper `r_farz` and `fog_enable`(no clipping or blue fog)
  * ~~`dota_use_particle_fow`~~ RIP too

* Utility:
  * Perfect Blink
  * Prevents bad spell casts(such as Black Hole/Chronosphere with no one in its radius)

* Visuals:
  * Weather changing(Ash, Spring etc)
  * River painting

I intend to implement most of the usual cheat functionality
