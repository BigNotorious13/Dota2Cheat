# Dota2Cheat
SDK folder code is from another github repo, McDota by LWSS. It's a very helpful source regarding memory structures
## Building
The only requirement is to compile as 64-bit
## Injecting
I recommend using [Extreme Injector v3.7.2](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=21570) with either Thread Hijacking or the default option

# Features
This list is subject to frequent change as I'm testing new features
* Illusion coloring(red for enemy's, green for friendly)
* Automatic Magic Wand and Faerie Fire usage(with potential of customizing the health treshold)
* Automatic Hand of Midas usage on nearby big neutrals, ranged & flagbearer lane creeps and catapults
* Automatic bounty rune pickup
* Convars:
  * `sv_cheats` spoofing
  * `dota_camera_distance` with proper `r_farz` and `fog_enable`(no clipping or blue fog)
  * `dota_use_particle_fow` â€” shows more particles in FoW, including the teleportation effects
  
I intend to implement most of the usual cheat functionality
